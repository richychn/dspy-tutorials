However, we do not have information about the status of the person or persons walking in the city. They could be celebrities or they could be non-celebrities. Without specific information about the individuals' celebrity status, we cannot logically conclude that a celebrity is walking in the city.",

The time frame given is that he will not play for another week. Since a trombone is an instrument, we can conclude that the boy will play an instrument, and the time frame does not change this fact.",
